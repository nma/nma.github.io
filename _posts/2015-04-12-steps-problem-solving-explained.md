Here is a quick post that explains problem solving in concise bullet points. I've found this gem while reading up a 
type of behavioural therapy called Problem-Solving Therapy (PST)[1]. This is a type of therapy in which therapists ask 
their clients to actively engage in problem solving to alleviate depression.

Regardless of the causes of depression, it leaves a lack of motivation, and an increase difficulty in problems solving
skills. 
"According to PST, the ideal way to intervene in this depression-producing cycle is to teach patients how to mobilize 
their coping resources and begin tackling the problems in their lives. 
Once they begin to solve problems, depression lifts and the motivation to face other problems increases." [1]

I feel like actively engaging in problem solving tasks or puzzles may increase our defence against depression during
our life times. In particular, this study includes a concrete definition of what we should pay attention to develope
critical problem solving skills.

According to D'Zurilla and Nezu, problem solving consists of five skills. 

    1. Problem Orientation
    2. Problem Definition 
    3. Generation of Alternative Solutions
    4. Decision Making
    5. Solution Making and Evaluation

In **Problem Orientation**, we should be "concerned with how one views his or her ability to cope with a problem"[1]. This
to mean implies that you must feel that the problem is do-able. In this TED talk about education

we can see how having the correct mindset will improve your problem solving skills drastically. 
"Scientists measured the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error, On the left, you see the 
fixed mindset students [who believe they can't solve the problem]. There's hardly any activity. They run from the error. 
They don't engage with it. 
But on the right, you have the students with the growth mindset [who believe they can solve the problem], 
the idea that abilities can be developed. They engage deeply. Their brain is on fire with yet. 
They engage deeply. They process the error [or problem]. They learn from it and they correct it."[2]


Next, **Problem Definition**, "which is concerned with the specific and concrete definition of the problem, and setting 
achievable and definable goals"[1]. By having good measurable goals, we don't demotivate ourselves when we miss a goal.
We can keep a healthy attitude because we clearly know what we can and cannot do. I think that setting pomodoro to figure
out the average time to take a task is a great way to get a quantified value on your abilities.


Followed by **Generation of Alternative Solutions**, which "involves creating various methods for solving problems 
and meeting one's goals while withholding judgment on their effectiveness."[1] Sometimes we can get caught up prematurely
eliminating solutions, this step is focused solely on brainstorming potential solutions, all ideas are up for grabs,
even the ones that clearly don't work. Being able to juggle multiple vectors of attacking a problem can make difficult
problems much easier. If you are lacking this skill, don't worry, if you watched the TED video above then you should know 
that we may not yet have the ability, but we can definitely improve.


Then we have **Decision Making**, which "involves a systematic process to select the best solution for a problem from the 
list generated."[1] Most of the times we have to make decisions in problem solving, but sometimes we get caught up in 
the choices. One advice that I read on a magazine (I forget which one), is that instead of worrying about the right
solution, you should think about how do you make it so any decision you make turns out right. That could mean pruning
the list based on what you can implement under the current situation.


Finally, **Solution Making and Evaluation**, which "involves planning and initiation of solutions, and subsequently 
evaluating the success of the solution." [1] 

The article also emphasizes that we should focus on mastering each step of the process to improve problem solving
skills. This structured approach at problem solving should definitely help outline what steps you are lacking in, and
what step you should focus on to allow yourself to keep tackling newer and harder problems over time.
