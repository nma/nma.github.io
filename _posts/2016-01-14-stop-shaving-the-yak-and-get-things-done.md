## Introduction

We all have been in places where we are tunnel visioned, or have spent countless hours yak shaving on something that
has no end results. [I looked at a reference manual for my car just to answer one question, but I spent the whole afternoon with my nose buried in it, just yak shaving, and got no work done on the car itself.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving)

I have been trying multiple ways to reduce the amount of yak shaving, but the urge to dive deep is really strong. Don't
get me wrong, diving deep is an essential skill to have, but if your diving down the wrong solution then all you have
accomplished is wasting time.

This is the crux of the problem, how do you know when a given action is useful to the task at hand?

Some solutions I have tried to get around yak shaving.

Willingness to admit that your solution is wrong.
Taking breaks to see the overall state of a task.
Identifying key metrics that track progress towards the end goal.
Knowing what the input, output are for the task at hand.

### Willingness to Admit that your Solution is Wrong

This is a big one. In an effort to protect your pride, you keep digging yourself deeper into your proposed solution
in hopes that you can redeem yourself eventually when the solution pays off. Now this is an issue, because you can
spend an entire afternoon writing a script that does nothing, when hard work with excel would have wrapped up the
issue in an hour.

I myself have been stuck in this all too often, and all it took was a quick 5 minute to break to get out of this
head space. I name this the negative flow, when you get into a flow state on some work that produces no results.

This leads into interval methods.

### Taking Breaks to see the Overall State of a Task

One good thing about interval methods is that you get a quick time to step out of any bad state of flow on regular
intervals. Though if you only get into the good state of flow, then of coures this method won't help you. I know others
who get annoyed by the intervals because it breaks their good flow.

Though if you ever find yourself consistently trying the wrong methods, intervals may be a good method to take get out
of any negative head space and keep yourself focused on productive activities.

### Identifying Key Metrics that Track Progress Towards the End Goal

Lately for any task, I always ask for specific input and output goals, followed by measurables that I can gauge progress
with.
This helps keep a paper trail of how effective you are progressing towards the task. Some people I worked with have
a natural sense of whats important or not, but I don't think I am so fortunate, so I substitute natural prowess with
strong proven processes. (of which these I picked up while working at Amazon)

### Knowing what the Input/Output are for the Task at Hand

Again, just to reinforce how helpful input and output goals are. We give an example. Say your manager Tom wants you to
wants you to complete a code, report, thing. You start working on it, then a few hours later, he decides to add on a minor
addition; you agree. The next day, he also drops by to give you a list of nice to haves, you notice that there is a tool
that can get you the bonus tasks, and before you know it, you spent the entire day working on it. The task is due tomorrow,
but the core components haven't even been started. Sound familiar?

If you had specific Input and Output, such as get data x and y, and make a report merging x with y. You wouldn't have
spent all that time performing frivolous activities with bonus features. You would review the Input and Output, and
aggressively pursue these to the exclusion of all else.

### Closing

These are just some of the solutions I have found to keep myself on task. Now I won't say that these will help you,
but it is some methods that I found works well for me. What tricks do you have to stay on task?
