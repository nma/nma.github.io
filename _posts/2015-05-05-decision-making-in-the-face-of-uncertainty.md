The main point of this post is to keep a brain dump of an interesting talk that I attended today. This talk mainly
details the components and processes that goes on behind making a big choices early on projects/situations.

The main sticking points for me on such a talk is as follows:

    1. How do we make a choice that will benefit the most in the future? -- use a model
    2. What are some context free rules for the decision process? -- define success metrics for the model

When making a big choice early on, the outcome of the choice trims away other choices. If we make a bad decision early
on we trap ourselves in a rabbit hole. This is both a fear in software projects and interviews. The talk I attended
defined a repeatable process that helps us make such choices.

The key component dicussed was **models**; Our decision has to be made based on a simplified model of the expected problem.
We have to build a much simpler model of the situation in our head, and make the decision based on the simplified 
representation. This helps steer the decision towards the desired output. (though this does not guarantee the best choice, 
a simpler model makes the problem much more tangible)

Now we know that models help, but how do we define what is a good and bad model? Well the golden quote about models
from George Box. [wikiquote](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box)

    "Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful."

Define how bad the model is from the actual solution; If we don't know what an adequate success metrics is, we still
aren't making a better decision. We can tweak the model we are building to align closer to the actual problem, and
once we are comfertable that the model is useful we can be sure that our decision is leading towards a proper solution.
